SportsTracker packaging (macOS, Linux, Windows)
===============================================

Info
----

* the tool 'jpackage' is used for creating native application packages for
  macOS, Windows and Linux
  * jpackage has been introduced with JDK 14
    (JEP 343, http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/343)
  * so at least JDK 14 is needed for packaging
  * jpackage is the replacement for the JavaFX packager which has been removed
    from the JDK, there is also no ANT plugin available anymore
* the created packages contain the required Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* has been tested with AdoptOpenJDK 16 on:
  * macOS 11.2, Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and Windows 10 (AdoptOpenJDK 14)
  * the packaged app and the installers are running perfectly without problems

* this directory contains the scripts for automatic SportsTracker packaging
* each os-specific package scripts creates an installer package
  (e.g. SportsTracker-7.x.x.dmg on macOS)
* only the following java modules (jmod) are needed:
  java.base,java.desktop,java.logging,java.net.http,java.scripting,java.sql,
  java.xml,jdk.crypto.ec,jdk.localedata,jdk.jsobject,jdk.unsupported
* the created app packages are much smaller, also caused by jmod usage
  * Example for macOS:
    * SportsTracker.app 7.5.1 built with JDK 10: 220 MB
    * SportsTracker.app 7.7.1 built with JDK 14: 140 MB


HowTo package
-------------

First on all platforms:

* make sure that the proper JDK and Maven are installed
* make sure that environment variable JAVA_HOME is set
* build SportsTracker via 'mvn clean package'

Then on macOS:

* check the app settings and path variables in 'package-macos.sh'
* run 'package-macos.sh'
* the created SportsTracker-x.y.z.dmg package is located in directory 'package'

Then on Linux (Ubuntu):

* check the app settings and path variables in 'package-linux.sh'
* run 'package-linux.sh'
* the created DEB installer package is located in directory 'package'

Then on Windows:

* make sure InnoSetup is installed, has been tested with 5.5.9u
* check the app settings and variables in 'package-windows.bat'
* run 'package-windows.bat'
* the created SportsTracker app package is located in directory 'package'
* open the InnoSetup project by opening the file 'SportsTracker.iss'
* update the properties in the project file (e.g. the version)
* run the installer creation (Run or F9)
* the created InnoSetup installer is located in directory 'package/InnoSetup'


macOS Packaging Notes
---------------------

* nothing special here


Linux Packaging Notes
---------------------

* Depending on the Linux system the created installer package is either an DEB
  (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) or an RPM (e.g. Fedora) package.
* DEB package creation requires the packages 'fakeroot' and 'binutils', can be
  installed from the distribution repository.
* Package installation command: sudo dpkg -i sportstracker-x.y.z.deb
* Package uninstall command: sudo dpkg -P sportstracker


Windows Packaging Notes
-----------------------

* The InnoSetup installer creation is not executed by the jpackager, it seems
  to support the WiX installer tool only. 
  The current WiX version requires an outdated .NET SDK, that's why the use of
  InnoSetup is preferred (lightweight and runs without problems).
* Therefore the installer creation has to be done manually after packaging.
